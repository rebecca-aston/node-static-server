 You can use this combined .gitignore for node & visual studio code. You can also just initialize your node.js repo with a Node gitignore then copy in the contents of your visual studio gitignore to the bottom of the file.

 Note this is not intended to be a github page. 

 In general, host any node applications that are just for tooling on Github in a repo that is private if you have any sensitive content in there.
