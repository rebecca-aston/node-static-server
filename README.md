# node-static-server
 
 This is a simple static server using node.js, a p5.js sketch with a minimal touch device demo is being served out of the public folder.

 You can use this combined .gitignore for node & visual studio code. You can also just initialize your node.js repo with a Node gitignore then copy in the contents of your visual studio gitignore to the bottom of the file.

 Note this is not intended to be a github page which cannot host node.js projects. You can see this app hosted on glitch [here](https://node-static-server.glitch.me).

 In general, host any node applications that are just for tooling on Github in a repo that is private if you have any sensitive content in there.
